## Report for ForestQuery into Global Deforeation, 1990 to 2016

ForestQuery is on a mission to combat deforestation around the world and to raise awareness about this topic and its impact on the environment. The data analysis team at ForestQuery has obtained data from the World Bank that includes forest area and total land area by country and year from 1990 to 2016, as well as a table of countries and the regions to which they belong.

The data analysis team has used SQL to bring these tables together and to query them in an effort to find areas of concern as well as areas that present an opportunity to learn from successes.

### 1. Global Situation
According to the World Bank, the total forest area of the world was 41,282,694.9 sq km in 1990. As of 2016, the most recent year for which data was available, that number had fallen to 39,958,245.9 sq km a loss of -1,324,449 sq km or -3.21%.

The forest area lost over this time period is slightly more than the entire land area of Peru listed for the year 2016 (which is 1,279,999.99)

### 2. Regional Outlook

In 2016, the percentage of the total land area of the world designated as forested was 31.38%. The region with the highest relative forestation was Latin America & Caribbean, with 46.16%, and the region with the lowest relative forestation was the Middle East & North Africa with 2.07% forestation.

In 1990, the percentage of the total land area of the world designated as forested was 32.42%. The region with the highest relative forestation was Latin America & Caribbean, with 51.03%, and the region with the lowest relative forestation was the Middle East & North Africa, with 1.78% forestation.






Table 2.1: Percent Forest Area by Region, 1990 & 2016:
The only regions of the world that decreased in percent forest area from 1990 to 2016 were Sub-Saharan Africa (dropped from 30.67%  to 28.79%) and Latin America & Caribbean 51.03% to 46.16%). All other regions actually increased in forest area over this time period. However, the drop in forest area in the two aforementioned regions was so large, the percent forest area of the world decreased over this time period from 32.42% to 31.38%.
